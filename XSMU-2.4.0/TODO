Description
-----------

The SMU is to stream voltmeter data at a specified frequency. This requires following features to be implemented.

	1) Dynamically change baudrate to suit data stream.

		-- CHANGE_BAUD

	2) Start recording

		-- START_REC : Starts recording of timed data into internal buffer.

	3) Transfer recorded data chunks to computer

		-- Two queues active and standby in firmware.

		-- REC_SIZE : Queries number of available data points in buffer
						
			-- Data from ADC keeps getting stored into the Active queue (interrupt driven)
			-- Software asks for REC_SIZE, firmware returns size of Standby queue

		-- REC_DATA : Transfers requested number of data points to driver
			
			-- Firmware transfers data from Standby queue to software (may be in multiple packets; \
					depends on size of stored data and size of comm packet)
			-- This transfer is uint32_t (ADC value) and not float. Conversion to float is to be done in software now.
			-- This requires the functions XX_setCalibration() to also save the calibration table in software.
			-- When no data remaining data in Standby queue (switch Active and Standby queues)

	5) Stop recording

		-- STOP_REC : Stops recording gracefully.
	
	6)

		-- KEEP_ALIVE : Stops recording if keep alive packets are not received, i.e. if driver is dead.
