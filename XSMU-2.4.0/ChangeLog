** It was noticed that if an ftdi interface was opened as a serial port, i.e. using /dev/ttyUSB*, FTDI.cxx was unable to communicate using that interface. There seemed to be a problem the way ftdi was being initialized. After going through a few example in net, the initialization sequence in FTDI.cxx has been corrected. Now the interface can be used even if it has been accessed through /dev/ttyUSB*.
